- Times are now rendered as local time based on the user's browser locale.

## Launcher
- New: The server address field will now also try other possible valid URLs if the address input is invalid or incomplete. See [#208](https://github.com/LANCommander/LANCommander/issues/208#issuecomment-2712374078) for more details
- Fixed: The "Manage Saves" dialog no longer crashes when opened (#207)
- The library list will now display a button to clear the filter instead of the "Browse Depot" button (#193)
- Fixed "Register" button (#214)
- Rebuilt save packing to be more reliable

## Nightlies
Nightly builds of both the launcher and server are now being hosted on GitHub under [action runs](https://github.com/LANCommander/LANCommander/actions/workflows/LANCommander.Nightly.yml). Docker builds are also being pushed to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/LANCommander/LANCommander/pkgs/container/lancommander). As all nightlies go, these are unstable builds and may not work as expected.

## Breaking Changes
The mounting paths for the Docker container have changed in v1.1.5. Directories that were in `/config` now live at `/app/config`. Please update your bindings accordingly.

## WinGet Packages
LANCommander is now available to install via WinGet! These packages are included in our CI, so releases will get automatically pushed to the public Microsoft source.
